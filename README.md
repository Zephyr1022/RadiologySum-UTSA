Radiology reports are essential in medical practice as they provide physicians with a detailed analysis of imaging examinations such as X-ray, CT, MRI and ultrasound. The Impression section of the report is a critical component, as it summarizes the most important findings in a clear and concise manner, allowing physicians to quickly understand the results and make informed decisions about patient care. Radiology reports are also useful in tracking the progress of a patient's condition over time, and for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. However, the process of generating impressions by summarizing findings is time-consuming for radiologists and may introduce errors, highlighting the need for careful review and accurate reporting.

This repo provides code for generating impressions using descriptions of findings and the imagages via multi-modal modeling.
