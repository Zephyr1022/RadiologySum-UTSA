nonopacification of the left vertebral artery beginning at the level of c7 and extending to approximately the c3 level. beyond this point it appears to be reconstituted by collateral vessels. this

entire right vertebral artery including segments v1 through v3 with minimal retrograde filling of the v4 (intracranial) segment. this is likely caused by a c2 right lateral process fracture extending
